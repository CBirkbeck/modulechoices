        "Module Description": "This module continues the study of real analysis from the previous semester and will introduce you to another important area of pure mathematics – group theory.\n\nReal Analysis is fundamental to Mathematics as it is the reason why Calculus works. You will learn about limits of functions and continuity before moving on to study the formal definitions of the derivative and integral of a function, and for what sorts of functions these actually make sense. This then leads to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which proves that integration and differentiation are essentially inverses of each other.\n\nGroup Theory is the study of symmetry, treated in an abstract way which then allows for application in many situations in Mathematics and beyond. You will start by developing a list of axioms for what a group should be, and then study the implications of these axioms: for example, what one can deduce about the possible sizes of subgroups (Lagrange’s Theorem), how to define functions between groups in sensible way (homomorphisms), when different groups are really the same (isomorphism), and how to use known groups to build new ones (product and quotient groups). Throughout, you will see many examples."

        "Module Description": "Computation and modelling are essential skills for the modern mathematician. While many applied problems are amenable to analytic methods, many require some numerical computation to complete the solution. The synthesis of these two approaches can provide deep insight into highly complex mathematical ideas.\n\nThis module will introduce you to the art of mathematical modelling, and train you in the computer programming skills needed to perform numerical computations. You will be introduced to the Python programming language and study algorithms for problems such as root finding. A particular focus of mathematical modelling is classical mechanics, which describes the motion of solid bodies. Central to this is Newton’s second law of motion, which states that a mass will accelerate at a rate proportional to the force imposed upon it. This leads to an ordinary differential equation to be solved for the velocity and position of the mass. In the simplest cases, the solution can be constructed using analytical methods, but in more complex situations, for example motion under resistance, you will use numerical methods to find the motion of a particle."

It has important applications to understand the likelihood of multiple events happening together in order to make rational decisions. You will be introduced to Kolmogorov’s modern axiomatic theory of probability and the concept of random variables. You will study both discrete and continuous random variables. Finally, will explore two applications of probability: reliability theory (which looks at the likelihood of the failure of a piece of equipment at some point in the future) and Markov chains (which model how the likelihood of being in different states evolves in time).\n\nMultivariable calculus extends concepts of calculus to functions of more than one variable. This leads to the idea of partial derivatives. You will learn how to differentiate functions of more than one variable, and how to do integrals of such functions along curves and over areas. You will also learn how to change coordinates in multiple integrals using Jacobians, and study Green's theorem in the plane."

(These topics are not strictly calculus but will be needed in calculus later on.) You will then study differentiation – how to determine the rate of change of one variable or function as another variable changes. You will meet the formal definition of the derivative, and discover how to differentiate from first principles, before learning various rules and techniques for differentiating more complex functions. You will also learn about applications to curve sketching and power series.\n\nNext you will study integration (the inverse of differentiation), learning various techniques, including substitution and integration by parts, and considering applications to finding areas and arc lengths. You will then learn about methods for solving first and second-order ordinary differential equations. Techniques covered here include reduction of order. and integrating factors. You will learn how to use the computer program Maple to solve differential equations numerically."

You will also learn about common set-theoretic notation and terminology, and a precise language with which to talk about functions. There is emphasis on precise definitions of concepts and careful proofs of results, which will prepare you for doing the same in future mathematics modules. You will study different techniques of mathematical proof, including: proof by induction, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, contrapositive statements, equivalent statements, the role of examples and counterexamples, and how to deal with “there exists” and “for all” statements.\n\nYou will explore the mathematical notion of a limit, which is the start of the branch of mathematics known as analysis. You will see the precise definition of the limit of a sequence of real numbers, and learn how to prove that a sequence converges to a limit. After studying limits of infinite sequences, you will move on to studying series, which capture the notion of an infinite sum, and learn techniques to prove that a series converges."

The power of this abstraction is that it allows the theory to be applied in many more situations: Linear Algebra underpins much of modern mathematics and is used in most sciences. You will learn what an abstract vector space is and its basic properties: in particular, how to make precise the notion of dimension by studying their bases. You will then look at linear transformation between vector spaces, including their kernel and image and the Rank-Nullity Theorem. You will see how, by fixing bases, a linear transformation can be encoded in matrix form, and how changing the bases changes that matrix. This will then allow you to study eigenvectors and the diagonalization of linear transformations.\n\nIn Analysis, you will cover the basic theory of functions of the complex plane, building on the theory of real functions. As well as being of intrinsic interest, complex functions are important for many applications in applied mathematics and beyond. While continuous complex functions behave in a similar way to real functions, you will learn how differentiability brings surprising extra constraints and rigidity, including the so-called Cauchy–Riemann equations. You will also study how power series can be used to represent functions, making precise the Taylor series seen in Calculus."

The theory you will see often allows these integrals to be done without calculus: instead, the Residue Theorem says it is enough to understand the function at a few specific points (the singularities of the function). This is especially important in applications in Applied Mathematics. This theory also allows you to calculate some real integrals which cannot be computed using real methods alone, as well as infinite series. Along the way, you will also see how Cauchy’s Theorem leads to the result that, in a certain sense, all differentiable complex functions are given by power series – which is not true for real functions.\n\nRing Theory is the study of mathematical structures like the integers, where we have good notions of addition and multiplication (as opposed to a group, where we only have one of these). Similar structures abound in mathematics so it is useful to see how much the theory of the integers can be extended to other rings – for example, factorization into primes, division with remainder and substitution. You will learn the basic theory of rings, including the notion of an ideal in a ring and its quotient ring, and study a variety of examples including polynomial rings."

While you will already have seen some techniques of solving ordinary differential equations, you will see  new techniques such as  series solutions and the method of Frobenius.  When the unknown quantity is a function more than one variable then the equation is known as a “partial differential equation” and the method of separation of variables will be introduced. Solutions involving Fourier series (representations of functions as infinite series involving trigonometric functions) are also considered. You will encounter a variety of important partial differential equations from applied mathematics, including heat equation, the wave equation, and Laplace’s equation. \n\nYou will then move on to study two methods that can be used to solve problems that occur in applied mathematics. Fourier transforms can be used to solve ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, and integral equations. The method of characteristics is a particular technique for solving partial differential equations by converting them to ordinary differential equations.  \n\nFinally, you will learn about techniques for analysing collections of coupled differential equations known as “dynamical systems”, which describe how certain variables evolve in time. The techniques here will help you analyse and understand the behaviour of nonlinear differential equations and acts as a starting point for the study of chaos."

You will then apply your knowledge of vector calculus to see how we formulate the differential equations that govern fluid flows. You will go on to solve simple fluid-flow problems, such as the determining the rate of flow out of a reservoir. \n\nYou will then examine how computers can solve differential equations and approximate continuous functions.

This generalises Analysis, using only basic set theory. You will begin by defining a topological space and will then investigate how analytic notions like limit points and continuity can be interpreted in terms of open and closed sets, as well as seeing how new topological spaces can be built from old ones. \nLinear transformations underpin much of modern mathematics and are the key to many applications. In many of these applications there is more structure, for example the dot product of vectors, and this is reflected in the structure of the linear transformations which arise. You will learn about bilinear forms and symmetric operators on vector spaces, which leads on to the diagonalization of symmetric linear transformations and the spectral theorem.

Named after the French mathematician Evariste Galois, who died in a duel aged 20, it gives a beautiful connection between the theory of solving polynomial equations and group theory. In fact, many fundamental notions of group theory originated in the work of Galois. For example, why are some groups called \"solvable\"? Because they correspond to the equations which can be solved (by some formula based on the coefficients and involving algebraic operations and extracting roots of various degrees). Galois theory explains why we can solve quadratic, cubic and quartic equations, but no similar formulae exist for equations of degree greater than four. In modern exposition, Galois theory deals with \"field extensions\", and the central topic is the \"Galois correspondence\" between extensions and groups."

It gives different insights into many branches of mathematics from calculus and analysis, where it explains how we can work with infinitesimals, to algebra where it gives new tools to work with groups and fields. Historically, mathematical logic led to the idea of computer programming, and recent developments include using computers to help mathematicians in new ways: not just in doing calculations but also in doing proofs.\nIn this module, we first formalize the language we use to do mathematics, making it precise enough to prove things about. We then give the basic notions of Proof Theory and Model Theory. \nProof Theory studies mathematical reasoning. You will see a Natural Deduction proof system, which gives us insight into how mathematical proofs work. A highlight is Gödel’s Completeness Theorem, which says that, for a suitably restricted (but still very large) part of mathematics, every true statement can be proved.\nModel Theory studies how mathematical theories and structures are characterised by axioms. We will see how some classes of structures can be described by axioms in our formal language, and others cannot. A highlight is the Compactness Theorem, which gives a way to build exotic mathematical objects such as an ordered field with infinitesimals."

Examples include the diffusion-limited growth of solid tumours, and the reasons why animal coats patterns are so widely varied - for example, why does the tiger have stripes and the leopard have spots? Mathematics has made fundamental contributions in these and many other areas which we will explore during the module.

The Calculus of Variations includes techniques for maximising integrals subject to constraints. A typical problem is the curve described by a heavy chain hanging under the effect of gravity. Asymptotic analysis provides a method for solving equations, or evaluating integrals, which involve small parameters, when exact results can not be found and when numerical solutions are difficult. A range of integral transforms are discussed which are useful for solving problems including integro-differential equations. This unit will include illustration of concepts using numerical investigation with MAPLE but no previous experience of using this software is assumed."

This generalises Analysis, using only basic set theory. You will begin by defining a topological space and will then investigate how analytic notions like limit points and continuity can be interpreted in terms of open and closed sets, as well as seeing how new topological spaces can be built from old ones. \nLinear transformations underpin much of modern mathematics and are the key to many applications. In many of these applications there is more structure, for example the dot product of vectors, and this is reflected in the structure of the linear transformations which arise. You will learn about bilinear forms and symmetric operators on vector spaces, which leads on to the diagonalization of symmetric linear transformations and the spectral theorem. This theorem is key to many applications in Statistics and Physics. Other topics you will study include polynomials of linear maps, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, and the Jordan normal form of a matrix."

It also considers the differing roles of the atmosphere and ocean as the module moves from shorter to longer timescales, demonstrating a \"seamless\" way of thinking about weather and climate prediction.  \n\nYou will develop a clear understanding of risks and opportunities of weather to people, organisations and to the wider environment. You’ll learn how to confidently source a diverse range of real-time weather information and you’ll practice analysing such data, leading subsequently to successful interpretation and effective communication. You’ll see, first hand, how weather and climate prediction depend upon computer systems for the efficient sharing, processing and visualisation of information. Being taught by weather practitioners and climate scientists with long experience of providing weather and climate services to users, you will get the inside track on what it’s like to work in weather and climate. \n \nThe module is taught using a combination of lectures and practical classes.  It is assessed by one piece of coursework which combines two short essay-style reports with data analysis of a synoptic weather situation, and analysis of how similar situations are projected to change in different parts of the world. \n \nThe module prepares students with skills required for weather forecasting, understanding climate prediction, and contributing to decisions on responses to climate change in both public and private sectors."

Named after the French mathematician Evariste Galois, who died in a duel aged 20, it gives a beautiful connection between the theory of solving polynomial equations and group theory. In fact, many fundamental notions of group theory originated in the work of Galois. For example, why are some groups called \"solvable\"? Because they correspond to the equations which can be solved (by some formula based on the coefficients and involving algebraic operations and extracting roots of various degrees). Galois theory explains why we can solve quadratic, cubic and quartic equations, but no similar formulae exist for equations of degree greater than four. In modern exposition, Galois theory deals with \"field extensions\", and the central topic is the \"Galois correspondence\" between extensions and groups.\n\nFor the advanced topics, you will study the so-called \"Inverse Galois problem\": does every group correspond to some polynomial, and is the answer dependent on the base field?"

Asymptotic analysis provides a method for solving equations, or evaluating integrals, which involve small parameters, when exact results can not be found and when numerical solutions are difficult. A range of integral transforms are discussed which are useful for solving problems including integro-differential equations.

Topics covered will include: CW complexes, elementary concepts of homotopy theory, fundamental groups, covering spaces, free products of groups and the van Kampen Theorem, and presentations of groups.\n\nFor the advanced topics, you will investigate some additional concepts and results such as: fundamental groups of graphs and the proof that every subgroup of a free group is free, K(G,1)-spaces, free products with amalgamation, and HNN extensions."

Beginning with special relativity, this module teaches the physical reasoning and mathematics (e.g. metrics and tensors) that lead to the equations of general relativity.  You will learn about the importance of general relativity in astrophysics - such as black holes, neutron stars, and gravitational waves - and some of the ways in which general relativity has been tested.\n\nSome of the material in this module is co-taught with PHY-6007A (general relativity); you may not take both. In this level-7 version you will also learn more advanced topics, including a greater focus on astrophysical phenomena where general relativity is important."

Please contact the module organiser if you need more detail on the prerequisites\n\nOur aim is to show how environmental problems may be solved from the initial problem, to mathematical formulation and numerical solution. Problems will be described conceptually, then defined mathematically, then solved numerically via computer programming. \n\nThe module consists of lectures on numerical methods and computing practical's; the practical's being designed to illustrate the solution of problems using the methods covered in lectures. We will guide students through the solution of a model of an environmental process of their own choosing. \n\nThe module provides training in mathematical and programming skills, as well support towards development of an independent numerical model project and associated project report. The skills developed in this module are highly valued by employers in such fields  as environmental research, meteorological agencies, , IT and quantitative analysis, environmental consulting and further study such as a PhD"
